# HyperCard Lite (PySide6 + Qt WebEngine)

A small, local, HyperCard-inspired prototype built in Python. It lets you create “stacks” of cards, put buttons and fields on them, script the buttons with a tiny language, and even run SQL against a separate user database — all in one window.

This repo is meant as a teaching / tinkering project, not a finished product.
